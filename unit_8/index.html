	<div id="philosophy">
			<p>Concentric Learning was built on the philosophy that education is more than just access to information. It is the satisfaction and nurturing of one of our greatest human assets: curiosity. Teaching one another is how we grow as a society and we have a responsibility to do it well. Concentric Learning approaches every project from the standpoint of making the learning clear, accessible and engaging. We endeavour to help our partners take full advantage of the available technology to create a transformative online learning experience.</p>
